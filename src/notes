#20250103
- spatial thinning needed in suitability function? can suffer from bias otherwise or was it done on purpose?

#20250102
- decided to provide "2015_Scenario1.tif" in the example to facilitate SRIT example run. Run into memory problems when
converting the ncdf4 file with 33 layers while running global suitability.R. Ask Ines how she has done it.
- crashes from L71 - "# split the target species suitability index values" below. probably needs a computer cluster - run in GAIA but what to do later
